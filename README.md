# adirel-token

The goal is to develop a token that is mineable that rewards miners for pooling GPU and CPU power to train AI. This AI system will be specifically tailored to collecting OSINT on human trafficking and taking steps to stop it, taking power away from the corrupt organizations and governments.

Rewarding participants for training AI models using blockchain-based tokens is an interesting concept and falls within the broader category of decentralized machine learning or AI on the blockchain. In this scenario, participants contribute computational resources, data, or algorithms to train and improve AI models, and they are rewarded with tokens for their contributions.

Components:
Smart Contracts:

Implement smart contracts that facilitate the interaction between participants and the AI training process.
Define rules for token rewards based on the quality and quantity of contributions.
Decentralized AI Platform:

Create a decentralized AI platform that leverages the blockchain for coordination and incentive distribution.
AI models and training datasets could be stored on the blockchain or decentralized storage networks.
Token Rewards:

Participants receive tokens as rewards for contributing resources, algorithms, or datasets.
Rewards could be based on factors like the accuracy of the contributed model, the size or relevance of the dataset, or the computational power provided.
Basic Workflow:
Contribution Submission:

Participants submit their contributions (e.g., machine learning models, datasets, algorithms) to the decentralized AI platform.
Consensus Mechanism:

Use a consensus mechanism (e.g., PoW, PoS, or other custom mechanisms) to validate and agree on the quality and legitimacy of contributions.
Token Rewards Calculation:

Smart contracts calculate token rewards based on predefined criteria such as model accuracy, data quality, or computational resources provided.
Token Distribution:

Distribute tokens to participants based on the calculated rewards.

Quality Metrics:
More on Quanitative Metrics <details>

Quantifying quality metrics in the context of AI contributions involves defining specific criteria and measurements to evaluate the performance, accuracy, and effectiveness of the contributed models or datasets. The choice of metrics depends on the nature of the AI task, and different domains may require different evaluation criteria. Below are some common quality metrics for various aspects of AI contributions:

For Machine Learning Models:
Accuracy:

Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. It is commonly used for classification tasks.
Precision and Recall:

Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability to capture all positive instances. Particularly relevant for imbalanced datasets.
F1 Score:

Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Useful when there is an uneven class distribution.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

For regression tasks, these metrics quantify the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC-AUC):

Measures the ability of the model to discriminate between positive and negative instances.
Mean Average Precision (mAP):

Commonly used in object detection tasks, mAP considers both precision and recall at various confidence thresholds.
Cross-Validation Performance:

Assess model generalization by using techniques like k-fold cross-validation.
For Datasets:
Data Completeness:

Ensures that the dataset contains sufficient information for the AI task.
Data Consistency:

Checks for uniformity and coherence in the dataset.
Data Diversity:

Measures the variety of instances in the dataset to ensure representativeness.
Relevance:

Evaluates how well the data aligns with the problem at hand.
Label Accuracy (for labeled datasets):

Assesses the correctness of labels assigned to instances.
Data Size:

Considers whether the dataset is large enough to support effective training.
General Considerations:
Task-Specific Metrics:

Tailor metrics to the specific AI task. For instance, natural language processing tasks may use metrics like BLEU score or perplexity.
Benchmarking:

Compare performance against established benchmarks or baselines.
Human Evaluation:

In some cases, human evaluators may be needed to assess subjective aspects of AI contributions, such as the naturalness of generated text.
Ethical Considerations:

Include metrics that consider ethical dimensions, such as fairness and bias.
Real-World Impact:

Consider the real-world impact of the AI contributions and how well they solve the intended problem.
Feedback Mechanisms:

Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback and improvement based on community input.
